1. Create and set up your Python environment.
2. Save the calculator script (calculator.py) and the test script (test_calculator.py) in your project directory.
3. Run the calculator by providing input through stdin. For example, from the terminal:
    ```bash
    echo "add 3 4" | python calculator.py

4. Test the calculator script by running the test_calculator.py script:
 ```bash
    python test_calculator.py

5. Follow the steps in "Step 3" to set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
